Badges
======
Badges is a simple productivity App used to keep track of how long a user can maintain a habit.
Each "badge" displays the current streak, as well as the total streaks achieved during its
lifetime. If a user fails to maintain a habit during a day, they simply tap the reset button
which brings their current streak to 0 and begins a new one. Tapping a badge displays more
information regarding its lifetime, such as a streak frequency distribution and a progress
report.

For demonstration purposes, the badges check for a reset on a short time interval. In a
practical setting, such checks would be performed once per day.
